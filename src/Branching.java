/**
 * 
 * A bus tour of Europe has been very successful. Due to an increase in the number of people who want to go on a tour, 
 * the tour company decided to increase the height of the bus. The new height of the bus is exactly N centimeters.
 * But the tourâ€™s route runs under a lot of bridges, and there is a chance that the bus will crash into one of these bridges. 
 * Can you find out if this will happen?
 * 
 * The first line of the input contains the height of the bus and the number of bridges under which the bus passes. 
 * The second line contains the heights of these bridges.
 * 
 * You should output "Will not crash" if everything will be alright; otherwise, output "Will crash on bridge i" 
 * (where i is the number of the bridge) into which the bus will crash. If the height of a bridge equals the 
 * height of the bus, the bus will crash.
 *
